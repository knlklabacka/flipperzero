I just got my FlipperZero two weeks ago and I was hopeful that is would be up and running in no time.
I should not have made that assumption.  I wanted to start with creating my own application.  Almost 
every online tutorial I came across did not work, with errors left and right.  I would start the 
tutorial and come across fbt errors, ufbt errors, git errors, firmware and app version mismatch.
I finally got one app to compile and load onto the FlipperZero.  I tried the process below several
times and got consistant results.  I hope this will help another noob out there.


Flipper Zero on Windows 10 or Windows 11

Programs you will before you start:
	python installed https://www.python.org/downloads/
	pip installed https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/
	Visual Studio Code installed https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Plug your FlipperZero into your computer with a USB-C cable.

Open a command prompt with administrator privileges.
	Press Windows+R to open the "Run" box.
	Type "cmd" into the box and then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run the command as an administrator.

Create a directory on you local computer
	ex. C:\FlipperZero
	> cd c:\ <enter>
	> mkdir FlipperZero <enter>
	> cd FlipperZero <enter>
	
Clone the git repository for the offical flipperzero-firmware.
	> git clone --recursive https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware.git <enter>
	Once this is complete you will have a new directory for the flipperzero-firmware
	at the time fo this writing (03/06/2024). Latest firmware is 0.98.3

Change Directory to downloaded firmware.	
	> cd flipperzero-firmware <enter>
	this is all of the firmware files for the flipperzero
	
Change directory to applications_user.
	> cd applications_users <enter>
	
Create a directory under /applications_users/
	> mkdir {APP_NAME} <enter>   /* {APP_NAME} is the name of the app you want to create
		ex. mkdir test_app <enter>
	
Change directory to new application directory
	> cd {APP_NAME} <enter>
	ex. cd test_app <enter>
	This is where you will create your app files.
	At the bare minimum you will need a .c and .fam file.
	
Here is an example app I got from 
	https://github.com/instantiator/flipper-zero-tutorial-app/tree/main
	Thank you instantiator.dev!
	You can download the zip file and copy the following into your applications_user/{APP_NAME}/ directory
		1. /images/cvc_36x36.png
		2. /images/one.png
		3. /images/two.png
		4. application.fam
		5. test_app.c
		6. test_app.png
		
	Rename the test_app.c to the name of your app, {APP_NAME}.c
	Rename the test_app.png to the name of your app, {APP_NAME}.png
	
	I'm sure there are better ways to do this but for those who are like me and extremely new to FlipperZero, this is what I did to get it working.
	
We now have the files we need to continue.

Launch Visual Studio Code.  I will refer to Visual Studio Code as VC.
	Here is the download link if you need it again. https://code.visualstudio.com/download
	
Once VC is installed and launched, open the folder for flipperzero-firmware.
	If you have been following along it's in C:\FlipperZero\flipperzero-firmware\
	If you get a prompt to trust the authors click 'Yes'.
	Close the 'Welcome' Tab.
	
You should now see the flipperzero-firmware directory listed in the 'Explorer' pane on the left.
	Click '>' next to applications_user directory.
	You should see the copied files from the example we downloaded before.
	
Go to the menu bar at the top of VC, click on 'Terminal', 'New Terminal'
	or you can use Ctrl+Shift+` to open the terminal window
	
	In the terminal we should see PS C:\FlipperZero\flipperzero-firmware>
	
In the terminal type in the following
	> cd .\applications_user\{APP_NAME}\
	Remember to replace {APP_NAME] with the app name you chose
	Your terminal should now show PS C:\FlipperZero\flipperzero-firmware\application_user\{APP_NAME}
	
Install ufbt (micro flipper build tool).  You need python installed to proceed.
	In the terminal window type the following
	> py -m pip install --upgrade ufbt
	

Before we build our app a couple things to double check are:
	Make sure the file names in your applications_user/{APP_NAME}/ match your app name.
	If you are using the example app from instantiator you have to change the source code in {APP_NAME}.c to match the name you gave your app
		#define TAG "test-app" -> would have to match your app name
		#include <test_app_icons.h> -> would have to match your app name.  This file is created during the build process.
		
	Make sure to change the .fam file to match your app as well.
	It should look similar to below:
		App(
			appid="test_app",  # Must be unique
			name="App test_app",  # Displayed in menus
			apptype=FlipperAppType.EXTERNAL,
			entry_point="test_app_app",
			stack_size=2 * 1024,
			fap_category="Examples",
			# Optional values
			# fap_version="0.1",
			fap_icon="test_app.png",  # 10x10 1-bit PNG
			# fap_description="A simple app",
			# fap_author="J. Doe",
			# fap_weburl="https://github.com/user/test_app",
			fap_icon_assets="images",  # Image assets to compile for this application
		)
	
		
You should now run the following command in the terminal to configure VC
	> ufbt vscode_dist	
	
Now you can run the command to build your application
	> ufbt build
	
	If you followed along you should see output like this
		PS C:\FlipperZero\flipperzero-firmware\applications_user\test_app> ufbt build
	scons: Entering directory `C:\Users\knlkl\.ufbt\current\scripts\ufbt'
			CC      C:\FlipperZero\flipperzero-firmware\applications_user\test_app\test_app.c
			CC      C:\Users\knlkl\.ufbt\build\test_app\test_app_icons.c
			LINK    C:\Users\knlkl\.ufbt\build\test_app_d.elf
			APPMETA C:\Users\knlkl\.ufbt\build\test_app.fap
			FAP     C:\Users\knlkl\.ufbt\build\test_app.fap
			FASTFAP C:\Users\knlkl\.ufbt\build\test_app.fap
			APPCHK  C:\Users\knlkl\.ufbt\build\test_app.fap
					Target: 7, API: 58.0
	PS C:\FlipperZero\flipperzero-firmware\applications_user\test_app> 


At this point you have two options
	1. Launch the app by typing in the terminal
		> ufbt launch
	2. Flash flipperzero 
		> ufbt flash_usb
		Flashing the flipperzero takes a couple minutes and show progress on the actual flipperzero
		If there are no errors you will see on your flipperzero Firmware update Success OK >
		
		
Take a look at your flipperzero.  If you used the ufbt launch command you should see the app running on your flipperzero.
If you used the ufbt flash_usb command you may need to open the app on your flipperzero.
	From your flipperzero navigate to Apps->Examples->{APP_NAME} to launch the your app.
		
Feel free to message me if you come across any issues. I can do my best to help
Let me know if you would like me to add instructions on install Python, pip or Visual Studio Code
